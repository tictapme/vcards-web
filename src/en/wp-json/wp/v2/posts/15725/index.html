This article is the first part in which we are going to develop the basic elements that make up the definition of this image and the reasons why it is an essential element in the development of a company&#8217;s marketing strategy. In the second part of the article, which will be published the following week, we will focus on how to execute a brand image campaign and what tools can help us along the way.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are starting a new project, you are still not clear about your brand image or you want to change it and renew the one you had originally, the first thing you have to do is to identify how your solution contributes to improving the lives of your users. For example, if we are talking about a luxury fashion brand, this brand brings a social status to its customers, it gives them a sense of exclusivity and elitism, since whoever wears these clothes will feel like one of the privileged few in the world with access to be able to buy them. On the other hand, a sports fashion brand mainly brings comfort, durability and practicality to those who wear its clothes and accessories to exercise. What are the main characteristics of your product or service and how can it positively impact the lives of those who consume it?<\/p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tictapcards.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/7811254-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15718\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.tictapcards.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/7811254-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.tictapcards.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/7811254-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.tictapcards.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/7811254-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.tictapcards.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/7811254-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.tictapcards.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/7811254-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption style=\"font-size:9px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.es\/vector-gratis\/ilustracion-concepto-creacion-marca_31385200.htm#query=brand&amp;position=2&amp;from_view=search&amp;track=sph\">Imagen de storyset<\/a> en Freepik<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n<p>Secondly, you should consider what is the most human identity of your company, what is your philosophy? If you are a family business that has been in the sector for decades and you follow your own production process, you can promote concepts such as proximity, tradition and trust. On the other hand, if you are a young company that is aware of current social struggles, such as equality, the environment or racism, you can make known how important some of these causes are in your decision making.<\/p>\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, you need to know what your potential customers are like, in order to connect with the audience you need to know what their habits and needs are and where your brand fits into their lives, from their point of view. To do this, analyse the data you have on your customers and also ask them personally to better understand what behaviour patterns they may follow and what value your product or service has for them.<\/p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tictapcards.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/group-of-casually-dressed-business-people-discussing-ideas-in-the-office-1-min-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15720\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.tictapcards.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/group-of-casually-dressed-business-people-discussing-ideas-in-the-office-1-min-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.tictapcards.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/group-of-casually-dressed-business-people-discussing-ideas-in-the-office-1-min-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.tictapcards.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/group-of-casually-dressed-business-people-discussing-ideas-in-the-office-1-min-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.tictapcards.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/group-of-casually-dressed-business-people-discussing-ideas-in-the-office-1-min-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.tictapcards.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/group-of-casually-dressed-business-people-discussing-ideas-in-the-office-1-min-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption style=\"font-size:9px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.es\/foto-gratis\/grupo-hombres-negocios-ocasional-vestidos-que-discuten-ideas-oficina_4691888.htm?query=brand\">Imagen de tirachardz<\/a> en Freepik<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n<p>Now that we have defined the message and the image that we want to accompany our brand, we will execute a marketing strategy to make it known.
