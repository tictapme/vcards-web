This article explains what it implies, how it can help you grow your business, and some ways and tools to optimize it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In marketing, engagement refers to the <strong>interactions we have with customers or social media users who may be potential customers.<\/strong> Interactions with your profile or posts may include: liking, leaving a comment, answering a survey, sharing it on their profile or sending it in a message to one of their friends, sending a direct message and saving the post to see it later. These are some of the most frequent ways of interacting and that give more results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having many followers doesn\u2019t mean that an account is well positioned on social networks, as followers can be bought and because many of those users may have started following the account a long time ago and even if they\u2019re no longer interested in it\u2019s content, they\u2019re not bothered because it\u2019s not even shown on their homepage. This is because <strong>most algorithms give priority to displaying the content that the user interacts with the most<\/strong>, as they understand that this is the content that interests them the most.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why is it important to maintain a good level of engagement on your social networks? <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On first place, <strong>it will make your brand have more reach<\/strong>, because if the algorithm detects your content as interesting for some users, it will recommend it to others with similar tastes. On second place, because <strong>it\u2019s a way to build customer loyalty<\/strong>. If you<strong> provide added value to users<\/strong> who know your brand and have already tried one of your products or services <strong>by creating content that helps them and entertains them<\/strong>, you\u2019ll make them identify with your brand and become a benchmark in that sector for them, and they\u2019ll come to you to repeat the transaction or try other of your products.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-13683 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/vcards.tictap.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/pexels-photo-4353618-e1667396750851-860x1024.webp\" alt=\"women engaging\" width=\"860\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vcards.tictap.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/pexels-photo-4353618-e1667396750851-860x1024.webp 860w, https:\/\/vcards.tictap.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/pexels-photo-4353618-e1667396750851-252x300.webp 252w, https:\/\/vcards.tictap.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/pexels-photo-4353618-e1667396750851-768x915.webp 768w, https:\/\/vcards.tictap.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/pexels-photo-4353618-e1667396750851-1290x1536.webp 1290w, https:\/\/vcards.tictap.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/pexels-photo-4353618-e1667396750851.webp 1597w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now you may ask yourself, <strong>how can I get a good engagement with my community?<\/strong> As I mentioned before, you have to create quality content that your followers will enjoy. To do this you first need to <strong>know the needs and aspirations of your audience<\/strong>. Also keep in mind that to capture their attention it has to be digestible and somehow entertaining.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But many times, even if the user finds your publication interesting, he\/she does not interact with it or perhaps only indicates that he\/she likes it. To achieve an interaction in which the user responds or comments you can spread your content on other channels such as Discord or Telegram. Increasingly, influencers and brands are setting up groups on these platforms to promote engagement with their followers in a more active way. This especially works in cases where the social media profiles already have some presence and a built-up community.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What can you do to get your customers and prospects to actively interact with the content you create for them if you are not established on a social network or perhaps your audience is not as active?<\/strong> <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vcards by TicTAP\u2019s digital business cards are a solution to this problem. If you don&#8217;t know what vcards are, you can find out in less than 5 minutes by reading our article: <a href=\"https:\/\/vcards.tictap.me\/en\/what-are-vcards\/\">What are vcards?<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through our vcards you can share much more than just your contact information as their functionalities go beyond those of a business card.
