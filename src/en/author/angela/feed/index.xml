										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vcards are the digital version of traditional business cards. They are a </span><b>tool that’s turning upside down how we connect with companies and between people</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They work in a simple way, by means of a QR code on your mobile you share your vcard with whoever you want to connect, for example, a prospect, an investor or a colleague. When the person scans the QR on their mobile, your information and the link to the card are automatically saved in their contact book. You can also </span><b>share it through a link</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by direct messages or email or adding it in your social media profile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vcards are an ecological and economical solution to the waste of single use paper caused by traditional business cards. If you decide to make the change, you will be adopting a</span><b> sustainable measure that will also save you money and with which you will ensure that your contact information is not lost or forgotten</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it often happens with many paper business cards. Vcards are also dynamic as they allow you to change the data and have it updated instantly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market consists of a wide variety of brands that offer digital business cards, but </span><b>vcards by TicTAP are the only 360 option</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, here’s why:</span></p>
<p><b>#offline</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They also work without signal or internet connection.</span></p>
<p><b>#noapp</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Neither you nor the other person need to download an app.</span></p>
<p><b>#content</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Share multimedia content such as photos, videos, presentations or brochures.</span></p>
<p><b>#traceable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They can be integrated with CRMs, ERPs or Analytics to measure interactions.</span></p>
<p><b>#languages</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ​​The information will be displayed in the language of the user who scans it.</span></p>
<p><b>#multi-brand</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set up different vcards for each brand or line of business.</span></p>
<p><b>#engagement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Interact with users through forms and surveys.</span></p>
<p><b>#customizable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We customize your vcards following the design of your brand.</span></p>
<p><b>#self-manageable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can manage them autonomously through our platform.</span></p>
