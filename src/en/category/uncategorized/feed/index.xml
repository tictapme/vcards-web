<p>Digital business cards are the solution that enables you to leave behind traditional paper cards. If you&#8217;re not aware of what these are, we recommend you read our article<a href="https://vcards.tictap.me/en/what-are-vcards/"><em> ¿What are vcards?</em></a>, in which we explain everything you need to know to get started. In this article we&#8217;ll give you the reasons for why you need to take them with you to the next conventions you attend.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The main objective of conventions and exhibitions is to publicize your company or project and connect with people who may be interested in investing in it or buying your products or hiring your services. It is one of the scenarios in which business cards and brochures are distributed for the most, but are often not very effective, because they get lost or end up in the bin.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Ideally, you should be able to share your contact and relevant business information, with interested visitors quickly, easily and effectively. This is possible with vcards by TicTAP. Just by showing a QR code on your mobile, the other person will scan it on theirs, and<strong> your contact information (name, email, and telephone number) and links to your website and to the vcard platform, will be transferred to their contact book.</strong> From there they will see catalogues, videos, and much more. <strong>You choose what content to upload!</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p>With <strong>vcards you will gain more comfort  at conventions</strong>, and you will be able to move around the stands without having to carry a mountain of paper to distribute. Wherever we go we always take our mobile phones with us so <strong>you can ensure that you&#8217;ll always have what you need to present with you your solution.</strong> You&#8217;ll also have saved time and money in printing the material, and most importantly, you will favor the environment!</p>
