										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term <strong>engagement</strong> has been gaining a lot of relevance during recent years in most companies&#8217; marketing strategies. This article explains what it implies, how it can help you grow your business, and some ways and tools to optimize it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In marketing, engagement refers to the <strong>interactions we have with customers or social media users who may be potential customers.</strong> Interactions with your profile or posts may include: liking, leaving a comment, answering a survey, sharing it on their profile or sending it in a message to one of their friends, sending a direct message and saving the post to see it later. These are some of the most frequent ways of interacting and that give more results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having many followers doesn’t mean that an account is well positioned on social networks, as followers can be bought and because many of those users may have started following the account a long time ago and even if they’re no longer interested in it’s content, they’re not bothered because it’s not even shown on their homepage. This is because <strong>most algorithms give priority to displaying the content that the user interacts with the most</strong>, as they understand that this is the content that interests them the most.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Why is it important to maintain a good level of engagement on your social networks? </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On first place, <strong>it will make your brand have more reach</strong>, because if the algorithm detects your content as interesting for some users, it will recommend it to others with similar tastes. On second place, because <strong>it’s a way to build customer loyalty</strong>. If you<strong> provide added value to users</strong> who know your brand and have already tried one of your products or services <strong>by creating content that helps them and entertains them</strong>, you’ll make them identify with your brand and become a benchmark in that sector for them, and they’ll come to you to repeat the transaction or try other of your products.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13683 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pexels-photo-4353618-e1667396750851-860x1024.webp" alt="women engaging" width="860" height="1024" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pexels-photo-4353618-e1667396750851-860x1024.webp 860w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pexels-photo-4353618-e1667396750851-252x300.webp 252w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pexels-photo-4353618-e1667396750851-768x915.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pexels-photo-4353618-e1667396750851-1290x1536.webp 1290w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pexels-photo-4353618-e1667396750851.webp 1597w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you may ask yourself, <strong>how can I get a good engagement with my community?</strong> As I mentioned before, you have to create quality content that your followers will enjoy. To do this you first need to <strong>know the needs and aspirations of your audience</strong>. Also keep in mind that to capture their attention it has to be digestible and somehow entertaining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But many times, even if the user finds your publication interesting, he/she does not interact with it or perhaps only indicates that he/she likes it. To achieve an interaction in which the user responds or comments you can spread your content on other channels such as Discord or Telegram. Increasingly, influencers and brands are setting up groups on these platforms to promote engagement with their followers in a more active way. This especially works in cases where the social media profiles already have some presence and a built-up community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What can you do to get your customers and prospects to actively interact with the content you create for them if you are not established on a social network or perhaps your audience is not as active?</strong> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vcards by TicTAP’s digital business cards are a solution to this problem. If you don&#8217;t know what vcards are, you can find out in less than 5 minutes by reading our article: <a href="https://vcards.tictap.me/en/what-are-vcards/">What are vcards?</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through our vcards you can share much more than just your contact information as their functionalities go beyond those of a business card. You can send <strong>push notifications</strong> to encourage users who have your saved contact to interact with the new content you post on the vcard, <strong>filling out surveys of all kinds, sending questions on the spot, or browsing through the menu where they will find videos or presentations </strong>created by you for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13678 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/menu-1-1024x700.png" alt="menu vcards by TicTAP" width="1024" height="700" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/menu-1-1024x700.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/menu-1-300x205.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/menu-1-768x525.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/menu-1.png 1049w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll also be able to <strong>link and concentrate all your social media profiles in the vcard</strong> to make sure your community knows where to find you and grow your presence through this platform. Vcards by TicTAP are a very useful tool to keep a close communication with your potential and existing customers.</span></p>

				<p>Traditionally, in meetings or networking events came a time when you exchanged your business card with a potential customer, provider or a contact that could be interesting for your work or your business. </p>
<p>In recent years the digital business card, or digital business card, has appeared. At first there was some suspicion. Therefore, many professionals and companies continued to bet on the card in cardboard or paper of a lifetime. </p>
<p>One of the barriers mentioned was that the impact created by the paper card was irreplaceable. Of course, for this it was necessary that it had a design and paper very well chosen and according to the brand.  </p>
<p>However, the VOCID-19 pandemic arrived. The tide turned overnight. As a result, events (meetings, fairs, congresses&#8230;) have been digitized. So in many causes networking is not done by physical presence but in videoconferences, etc.</p>
